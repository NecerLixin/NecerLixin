ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Li Jinliang Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at Huazhong Agricultural University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. My primary interests lie in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I am passionate about exploring how these technologies can be applied to solve real-world problems and improve our understanding of intelligent systems.

ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m building my knowledge base in both the theoretical and practical aspects of AI. Iâ€™m diving deep into algorithms, model optimization, and their applications across various domains. Some of my key areas of focus include:

	â€¢	NLP: Language modeling, text classification, sentiment analysis, and question answering.
	â€¢	Deep Learning: Neural networks, computer vision, and generative models.
	â€¢	Machine Learning: Supervised/unsupervised learning, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m always eager to collaborate on exciting projects and open-source contributions, so feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to work together or share ideas!

ðŸ”§ My current toolkit includes Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Hugging Faceâ€™s NLP tools.
